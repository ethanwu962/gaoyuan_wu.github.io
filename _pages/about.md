About Me
=====
Hello! I’m Gaoyuan Wu, currently pursuing a Master’s degree at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My primary research interests lie in computer vision and robotics, particularly in the integration of perception and intelligent control for autonomous systems.

I have been actively involved in projects related to embedded systems, robotic control, and visual recognition, and I am passionate about applying computer vision techniques to real-world robotic applications. My goal is to contribute to the development of more efficient, intelligent, and reliable autonomous systems by bridging the gap between sensing, understanding, and action.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my academic background, project experiences, and research interests. I’m always open to collaboration and meaningful discussions with fellow researchers and engineers!
